# Speed up aggregate roots loading with snapshot events

[Rails Event Store](https://railseventstore.org/) 2.7 is coming with a new experimental feature: `SnapshotRepository`.

<!-- more -->

In event sourcing, each change to the state of an aggregate root is recorded as an event in the event store, linked to the specific stream.
This allows for a complete history of changes to be tracked, but can also lead to slow performance if there are a large number of events within a single stream.

A general rule of thumb is to design short-lived streams in terms of the events count. However, you can find yourself in a situation where the streams rapidly grows too big and loading it becomes a performance bottleneck.
You need a quick solution to deal with this problem.

This is where Snapshotting comes in.

## Many possible implementations

There are several ways of snapshots implementation. 

They can be treated as a kind of technical events, or they can be stored elsewhere.
If you goes with the first approach, you can either use aggregate root's stream or a separate one.
It is not so obvious how to actually dump the state of the aggregate for a persistence.
We can also debate if Aggregate root should know about being snapshotted or not.

So many things to consider made us blocked to provide a ready-to-use solution for some time.
During our last RES camp in Pozna≈Ñ, we decided to break the deadlock and provide a simple solution to check if it is a good fit for the community.

## RES implementation

For a initial implementation, we decided to go with an alternative aggregate root repository storing snapshots in a separate stream for a given interval of events.

```ruby
# saves aggregate snapshot on each 50 events
repository = AggregateRoot::SnapshotRepository.new(event_store, 50)
```
