# Where should I keep my commands and events?

When integrating two components, you may wonder who should own the commands and events you want to use for communication. Today, I will show you a simple heuristic that may help you make this decision. The heuristic relies on the **frequency of change** in components. Before using it, we should visualize relationships between those components. Context Mapping is a perfect tool for that, as it shows how changes in one Bounded Context affect others (there is an excellent resource about the concept itself [here](https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping)).

And now, without further ado, let's jump into an example. Let's assume that we have two BCs: Registration and Payment. Registration BC changes a lot (green dots below mean a single change), as it has some rules that can change. On the other hand, Payment BC rarely changes.

<img src="<%= src_original("where-should-i-keep-my-commands-and-events/frequency_of_change_01.jpg") %>" width="100%">

Now let's assume we decided to communicate between those BCs using commands/events (interfaces) from the Registration BC:

<img src="<%= src_original("where-should-i-keep-my-commands-and-events/frequency_of_change_02.jpg") %>" width="100%">

It means that by doing that, we also defined the upstream-downstream relationship between those BCs, where Registration BC is upstream:

<img src="<%= src_original("where-should-i-keep-my-commands-and-events/frequency_of_change_03.jpg") %>" width="100%">

It also means there is a bigger chance that changes in the Registration BC will cause some changes in Payment BC. There is a higher coupling between those two BCs. To make it looser, we should change the direction of the upstream-downstream relationship. We can do it by simply using commands/events from Payment BC for communication like this:

<img src="<%= src_original("where-should-i-keep-my-commands-and-events/frequency_of_change_04.jpg") %>" width="100%">

It's worth noticing how the names of interfaces changed based on which BC was the upstream â€” such an experiment can sometimes impact how we see things.

You can use the described heuristic to fix some relationships or to create them wisely if you integrate new Bounded Contexts. Of course, there are always more nuances, like, for example, changes in model vs. changes in contracts, but that can be a topic for a different story ðŸ˜‰
