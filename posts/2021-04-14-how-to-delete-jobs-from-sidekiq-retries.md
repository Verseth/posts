Hi future-me! This is just a list of snippets I might be looking for next time I suddenly have to deal with a huge list of failing Sidekiq jobs being retried over and over.

### List job classes sitting in the retries list

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new
  .map(&:display_class)
  .uniq
```

### Number of jobs being retried for a specific class

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new
  .select { |j| j.display_class == "AJob" }
  .count
```

### Delete all jobs for a class from the retries list

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new
  .select { |j| j.display_class == "AJob" }
  .map(&:delete)
```

(similarly, there's `&:kill`, `&:retry`)

(similarly, there's `Sidekiq::DeadSet`, `Sidekiq::ScheduledSet`)

### If the jobs are RES async handlers, list the events:

```ruby
Sidekiq::RetrySet.new
  .select  { |j| j.display_class == "MyAsyncHandler" }
  .collect { |j| j.args[0]["arguments"][0]["event_id"] }
  .collect { |id| Rails.configuration.event_store.read.event(id) }
```

(warning: the details depend on your [RES](https://railseventstore.org/docs/v2/install/) async scheduler implementation)
