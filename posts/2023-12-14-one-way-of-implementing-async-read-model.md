# One way of implementing async read model

Let's start with claryfing few terms before we begin, just to make sure we're
on the same page.

## What is a read model
In an event sourced system (or part of the system that is event sourced) the truth lays in the event store. However, event stores are not optimized for reading the data. Therefore, it is more convenient to use read models.

A read model is a denormalized data model built using the data coming from the events.

You can think of it as a more convenient, handy data model that makes reading the data for the UI easier and faster.

In this particular example, the read model will be implemented as an event handler

## Sync
Although we'll focus on the async read model in this blog post, I think you might also be interested in learning about the sync read model.

Sync is the abbreviation that comes from the word synchronous. We use it quite a bit, so I thought it might be useful to make it clear.

When a read model is built synchronously, both the event and the read model are stored in the database within the same process.
Usually that process is either a user request that causes some object to publish an event, or a worker.

The good thing about using synchronous read models is that we have instant consistency.
This is especially important when we think about a user making a POST request that changes the state of the application. The state change is immediately reflected in the in the read model, which means we can rely on that information and get it back in the from the response. This makes it easy to display in the UI. It is not so easy with asynchronous read models.

The bad part is that if the read model update fails for some reason,
the POST request will also fail. This happens even if the write part
is successful. As a result, the user would see some error. Of course, you can take care of the the error part by adding a few rescues here and there, but this would make your read make your read model inconsistent. Which is something we don't want. And you'd have to rebuild that read model anyway.

Also, you often have more than one event handler subscribing to an event. The more sync event handlers that subscribe to an event, the higher the chance that the that the request won't be processed successfully. Also, the more handlers, the more IO operations, so the request will take longer. More often than not, the approach of using only sync event handlers leads to an unacceptable amount of time to to process the request. Which in turn makes for bad UX.

## Async
Async is short for asynchronous.

When a read model is built async, the event handlers are executed by the background workers. This is great because we can scale the handling of events independently of the web server.

Also, if processing an event fails, then it is up to the queue mechanism to deal with it. It's likely that as a Rails developer you use the sidekiq.
I'll use it for this example as well. Sidekiq has an auto retry that you can use. 
Sometimes the event will not be processed due to a transient error. 
In this case, time will heal the wounds.  In other cases, the error will require code fixes. With async handlers, there's the convenience of being able to fix the error, deploy, and retry the job that handles the event. However, the user experience would be poor in this  experience in this case because we're talking about read models, which, as I said, is something that users like to browse.

But nothing comes for free. Async requires us to deal with eventual consistency.

## Implementing async read model
As mentioned above, we need some sort of background worker to set up an asynchronous event handler. I'll assume you're familiar with sidekiq. In this case, I'll show you how to set up an event handler in application that uses ActiveJob to perform background operations.

```ruby
class BuildOngoingQuiz < ActiveJob::Base
  prepend RailsEventStore::AsyncHandler

  def perform(event)
    ongoing_quiz = OngoingQuiz.new(quiz_id: quiz_id = event.data.fetch(:quiz_id))
    ongoing_quiz.answer_id = answer_id = Integer(event.data.fetch(:answer_id))
    ongoing_quiz.question_id = question_id = Integer(event.data.fetch(:question_id))
    question = Questions::DDD.fetch(:questions).select do |question|
      question.fetch(:question_id) == question_id
    end.first
    ongoing_quiz.question = question.fetch(:question)
    ongoing_quiz.answer = question.fetch(:answers).select { |answer| answer.fetch(:id) == answer_id }.first.fetch(:answer)
    ongoing_quiz.save!
  end
end
```

Let's take a look at the `BuildOngoingQuiz` read model example.
This read model subscribes to quiz answers and builds a simple view of of questions <-> answers for the supervisor, who can then see how the person taking the who is taking the quiz.

In this example I used the `ActiveJob::Base` to handle my sidekiq jobs. This affects the way I have to set up the scheduler, we'll get to that in the next paragraph.

The `RailsEventStore::AsyncHandler` module is included to deserialize the event for the active job. I can access the event directly instead of going through the payload.
For an alternative approach, please see the doc.

Note that this is a simplified implementation. [There are other aspects to consider when designing an async read model](https://blog.arkency.com/read-model-patterns-in-case-of-lack-of-order-guarantee/)

### The scheduler
In this project I am using RailsEventStore's predefined `JSONClient`. [You can read more about that here.](https://blog.arkency.com/first-class-json-b-handling-in-rails-event-store/)

Although it is predefined, I want you to be aware of the part with the scheduler as it is very important and often confused.

The scheduler is used to define how the subscriber of the event is handled. The default implementation of the `JSONClient` uses `ActiveJobScheduler`. The scheduler must define a call and verify methods. In the case of the async scheduler, the verify method answers the question of whether the called subscriber is properly defined as an is a correctly defined async class. The call method knows how to call the Subscriber.
In the most standard case of ActiveJobScheduler, these methods are implemented as follows:

```ruby
    def verify(subscriber)
      if Class === subscriber
        !!(subscriber < ActiveJob::Base)
      else
        subscriber.instance_of?(ActiveJob::ConfiguredJob)
      end
    end

    def call(klass, record)
      klass.perform_later(record.serialize(serializer).to_h.transform_keys(&:to_s))
    end
```

Full implementation available here.

### Async scheduler when there's no active job in the project
There are situations when it is more convinient to rely on Sidekiq::Job directly,
without the ActiveJob facade. In that case you need a slighly differnet scheduler.

There's implementation that you can use or you can code it on your own if 
you wish not to get another gem dependency in your project. The verify and call
methods could be implemented as follows:
```ruby
    def verify(subscriber)
      Class === subscriber && !!(subscriber < Sidekiq::Worker)
    end

    def call(klass, record)
      klass.perform_async(record.serialize(serializer).to_h.transform_keys(&:to_s))
    end

```

And the BuildOngoingQuiz read model it could be implemented as follows:

```ruby
class BuildOngoingQuiz < ActiveJob::Base
  include Sidekiq::Job

  def perform(event)
  end
end
```

If you're using different driver for your queue, all you have to do is to implement
the verify and call methods.

## Common mistake
There's a common mistake with the async event handler subscription that we see in the projects we consult. I want you to be aware of it.

`event_store.subscribe(BuildOngoingQuiz.new, to: [QuestionAnswered])`

At first glance, this code looks fine and raises no suspicions.
But this is not a proper subscription to the async event handler! Even if you inherit from the `ActiveJob::Base`.
This event handler is always executed synchronously.

Also, the same object will always be used to handle new events.

Sometimes the cause of this error is that people want to include 
dependencies into the event handler/subscriber. 

It is not possible to do it that way and keep the event handler asynchronous.

Please keep this in mind. If you use RES in your project, it's a good moment to check that you don't have event handlers that unintentionally subscribe to events in this way ;).

But if you do, don't rush to remove the `.new' part. This change will affect
behavior of your application. You'll run into the potential consistency problem
that I described at the beginning of this article.
