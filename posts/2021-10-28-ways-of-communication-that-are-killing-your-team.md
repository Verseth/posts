## `@here`-ing too

What are you going to do when there's a real DEFCON? There's no bigger way of grabbing people's attention.

## ping inflation

ping not enough, DM needed

## meeting to solve everything

## video on

## meetings scheduled without consideration for context switching

## meetings as a default mode of communication

go for text instead

easier to reread, don't have to repeat, don't have connectivity problems

focus problems

# Secretive conversations

- private channels
- group DMs

Why?


<!--

if it's a meeting then it's obivously work. Why people look bad at wasting time when working individually? But when on a group call, wasting time suddenly is ...

problems with calls
"can you repeat"
"sounds good"
weary
cannot reread

also priv messages

meetings drain energy
meetings drain attention budget
you wan't to make sure you're doing that for a good reason
