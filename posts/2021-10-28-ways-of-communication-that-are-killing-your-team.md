## `@here`

what about  a real defcon

## ping inflation

ping not nuff, DM needed

## meeting to solve everything

## video on

## meetings scheduled without consideration for context switching

## meetings as a default mode of communication

go for text instead

easier to reread, don't have to repeat, don't have connectivity problems

focus problems

# Secretive conversations

- private channels
- group DMs
